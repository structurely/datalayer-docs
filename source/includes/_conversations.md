### Domains

To use domains other than the default real_estate domain, the domains have to be enabled in the settings and an appropriate lead type has to be selected in the lead_type slot. An example of using the mortgage scripts for a new home loan buyer would be to set the `allowedDomains` settings value to `["real_estate", "mortgage"]` and setting the lead_type slot to the values `"buyer"` and `"new_home_loan"`.
